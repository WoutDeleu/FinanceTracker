# finance_tracker

Welcome
This App is made by Wout Deleu and Elian Vantomme as a school project for KU Leuven (subject: Mobile Application)!


As students, we are constantly watching our weekly budget, but it's not always easy to keep track of your spendings. That's why we decided to build an app to help you keep track on what you weekly spend. You can add expenses, add bills, and divide them into categories."

Enjoy, 
Elian & Wout"
